# BI Tools

While metriql is a relatively new project, we're working on integrating BI tools using our low-level integrations such as [REST API](rest-api) and [JDBC driver](jdbc-driver). If your BI tool already has integration with Trino (formery Presto), you can use the metriql URL and port `5656` to connect your metriql server. Note that metriql doesn't embed Trino, it acts as Trino for the BI tools but internally it rewrites the query and directly runs it on your database.

While we will develop the support for some of the most popular BI tools but we need help from the community to integrate metriql to the BI tools of your choice. 

1. Please see the relevant Github issue if you would like to contribute.
2. Let us know if you would like to suggest a new integration on [Github](https://github.com/metriql/metriql/issues/new)
3. If you're a BI vendor looking for a way to integrate metriql, join our community on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/metriql/shared_invite/zt-qp9ds5te-EqzlN79caX76uH~2yqygpA).
