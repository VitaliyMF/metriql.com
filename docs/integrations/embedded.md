# Embedded Analytics

You can use [REST API](rest-api) in order to build analytical applications.You can build single page applications using your preferred chart and front-end frameworks and use metriql REST API as the backend. The API supports [Authorization](/rest-api#authorization) and CORS out of the box.

We will soon release a sample project built with Auth0 and metriql.
