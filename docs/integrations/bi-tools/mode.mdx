# Mode Analytics

Mode Analytics is a BI tool for data scientists and analysts. It doesn't provide any way to define the metrics. Instead, it provides a notebook interface that you can run SQL queries. 
You can connect to Metriql from Mode using its Trino connection as follows:

Once you connect to Metriql, you can use [MQL](/query/mql) to run queries on your data warehouse:

Under the hood, Metriql compiles your query to:
