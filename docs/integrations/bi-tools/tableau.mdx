You can connect to metriql from Tableau using Presto integration. On top of the Presto integration, metriql creates Tableau Data Source (TDS) files form your datasets. The generated TDS file has all the relevant info about your dataset such as relations, labels, and measures so that you don't need to do any data modeling in Tableau.

Once you download and open the file, enter your credentials, you should see all the info about your dataset inside the workbook:
