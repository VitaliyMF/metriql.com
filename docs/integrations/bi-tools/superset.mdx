You can connect to metriql from Superset using Trino driver in order to query the datasets from both SQL Lab and [query builder](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/exploring-data). In addition to the Trino driver, we also provide a native integration with our [open-source Superset driver](https://github.com/metriql/metriql-superset) to syncronize Metriql datasets as Superset datasets with metrics & column definitions.

Once you start Metriql, you should enter your Superset URL and credentials in the dashboard as follows:

When you click synchronize database button, we create all the Metriql datasets under the data or edit them if they're already created.
