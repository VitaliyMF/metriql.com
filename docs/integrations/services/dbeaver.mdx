# Dbeaver

Dbeaver supports Trino and earlier versions have support for Presto. You can connect Metriql using its Trino / Presto interface as follows:

Once you connect to the database, you can run [MQL](/query/mql) and see the result as follows:

If you protect your Metriql with username password pair, you need to enable SSL to access Metriql. 
Please note that if you're running Metriql locally where you don't have SSL, it's easier to disable the password access and leave the password field empty in Dbeaver.
