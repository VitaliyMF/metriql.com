# Jetbrains DataGrip

Datagrip is an SQL client for desktop. The latest versions already support Trino but in case you don't see Trino in databases, you can also use Presto. 
Here is how you can set up Metriql connection:

Once you connect to the database, you can run [MQL](/query/mql) and see the result as follows:

If you protect your Metriql with username password pair, you need to enable SSL to access Metriql. 
Please note that if you're running Metriql locally where you don't have SSL, it's easier to disable the password access and leave the password field empty in Datagrip.
